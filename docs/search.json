We will utilize the powerful framework of ABC-XYZ inventory classification model to analyze transaction data for products. By performing this analysis, we will be able to extract valuable insights and identify trends that can help inform strategic decisions around inventory management."

This gap can be solved using the XYZ inventory classification which categorize products according to their level of demand variability.\nThere are three categories in XYZ analysis which are:\n\nClass X: These are items with low demand variability, they are less challenging to manage because of their predictable demand patterns.\n\n\nClass Y: Items in this class have a moderate demand variability they are less easer to manage than items in class X but have better predictable patterns than items in class z.\n\n\nClass Z: There is a high demand variability in items that falls within this category, demand for product are less stable and predictable.\n\n\n(\n    g.ggplot(data=df_m.groupby(\"month\")[\"quantity\"].sum().reset_index(), \n             mapping=g.aes(x=\"factor(month)\", y=\"quantity\", group=1)) +\n    g.geom_line() +\n    g.scale_y_continuous(labels = lambda l: [\"{:,.0f}\".format(v) for v in l]) +\n    g.labs(x=\"Month\", y=\"Quantity\", title=\"Quantity Demand by Month\") +\n    g.theme(figure_size=(10, 4)) \n)\n\n\n\n\n<ggplot: (193133998062)>\n\n\nA rundown of the seasonality in the data shows that the total customer order by month have huge variablility across the year with its lowest point in August while its peaked in December.

Since only 7.86% of all product falls under the AX class, inventory managers can bring in more products from other class by reviewing price strategy, imporving marketing and promotion and also consider bundling or cross-selling with other high performing products such as products in class AX and AY.\n\nabc_xyz_plot(var=\"total_revenue\", \n             y_title=\"Revenue\", \n             title=\"Total Revenue by (ABC-XYZ) Class\")\n\n\n\n\nClass AX and AY both contains majority of products that generate the highest revenue, a combined 72% of revenue. Inventory managers should consider conducting market research on products generating less revenue to identify trends and customer preferences. This can help them identify new opputunities and adjust product features and marketing accordingly.\nIn summary ABC-XYZ analysis provides insight that inventory managers can utilize to optimize inventory business operations, by indentifying the most critical items and assigning appproprate inventory control policies, businesses can better manage their stock and ultimately improve customer satisfaction. Additionally, its can help inventory managers to identify opportunities for process improvement, enhance decision-making, and allocate resources effectively."

This gap can be bridged using the XYZ inventory classification which categorize products according to their level of demand variability.\nThere are three categories in XYZ analysis which are:\n\nClass X: These are items with low demand variability, they are less challenging to manage because of their predictable demand patterns.\n\n\nClass Y: Items in this class have a moderate demand variability, but they are not easy to manage unlike items in class X, but they have better predictable patterns than items in class Z.\n\n\nClass Z: There are high demand variability in items that falls within this category, and demand for product are less stable and predictable.\n\n\n(\n    g.ggplot(data=df_m.groupby(\"month\")[\"quantity\"].sum().reset_index(), \n             mapping=g.aes(x=\"factor(month)\", y=\"quantity\", group=1)) +\n    g.geom_line() +\n    g.scale_y_continuous(labels = lambda l: [\"{:,.0f}\".format(v) for v in l]) +\n    g.labs(x=\"Month\", y=\"Quantity\", title=\"Quantity Demand by Month\") +\n    custom_theme()\n)\n\n\n\n\nA rundown of the seasonality in the data indicate that the total customer order by month have huge variablility across the year with its lowest point in August while its peaked in December.

This indicate that there were fluctuations in the order volume with some days witnessing a high number of deliveries while others had comparatively lower activity. This variability also suggests the influence of various factors such as customer demand, marketing campaigns, seasonal trends, or external events that impacted the order on a daily basis. The analysis also identifies specific dates that stand out in terms of number of orders delivered. The largest delivery day occurred on August 27th, on the other hand the analysis highlight two days, namely February 12th and July 22nd, with the lowest number of orders supplied. Interestingly, these days recorded only a single order being fulfilled. The low activity in these days could be an indication of various factors such as low customer demand, seasonality or other external factors affecting order placement.\n\n\n\nNumber of orders delivered on weekdays and weekends:\n\n\nShow the Code\ntemp |&gt; \n  summarise(count = n(), .by = week_day) |&gt; \n  mutate(percentage = proportions(count)*100) |&gt; \n  \n  ggplot(aes(x = week_day, y = count)) +\n  geom_col(fill = colr$bar) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma_format()) +\n  labs(x = NULL, y = \"Count\", title = \"Number of Supplied Order by Day of the Week\") +\n  custom_theme()\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above plot indicates that a majority of the orders supplied to customers, specifically 92.7%, took place on weekdays, while the remaining 7.3% occurred on weekends. This distribution indicate more customers received their orders during weekdays compared to weekends. Analyzing the distribution of delivery within weekdays, the plot reveals interesting patterns. Among all the weekdays, Mondays stand as the day with the highest number of orders received by customers, accounting for 19% of the total. On the other hand, the analysis highlights that Sundays had the lowest number of orders received, with only a handful of orders (593) being fulfilled. suggest This indicates relatively lower customer engagement on weekends especially on Sundays. These insights can be used to align staffing levels, logistics, and customer support accordingly, ensuring timely and reliable deliveries while meeting customer expectations\n\n\n\nNumber of orders delivered in each month:\n\n\nShow the Code\ntemp |&gt;\n  summarise(count = n(), .by = month) |&gt;\n  mutate(percentage = proportions(count)*100) |&gt; \n  \n  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = count, group = 1)) +\n  geom_line(color = colr$line, linewidth = 1) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma_format()) +\n  labs(x = NULL, y = \"Count\", title = \"Number of Supplied Order by Month\") +\n  custom_theme()\n\n\n\n\n\nThe analysis of the number of orders received by month reveals several key trends. In the first quarter of 2018, there was a steady increase in the number of deliveries, indicating a positive growth trajectory. This upward trend continued until April, which emerged as the second-best month in terms of the number of orders delivered. However, the second quarter witnessed a decline in delivery volume. This decline persisted throughout the quarter, with a notable dip in July. Interestingly, there was a significant upturn in delivery performance during August. This month witnessed a drastic increase in the number of orders delivered, signaling a substantial improvement compared to the preceding months.The analysis indicates that August accounted for approximately 15.8% of the total orders delivered during the year, making it the month with the most product deliveries. This high delivery volume suggests increased customer activity, potentially due to various factors such as seasonal sales, promotional campaigns, or other market influences driving demand.\nUnderstanding the dynamics of August and the factors contributing to its exceptional delivery performance can provide valuable insight. These insights can inform future strategies, such as capitalizing on peak demand periods, optimizing logistics operations, and planning marketing initiatives to replicate or even surpass the success achieved during August.\n \n\n\n\nOrder status\n\n\nShow the Code\norders |&gt;\n  count(order_status, sort = TRUE, name = \"count\") |&gt;\n  mutate(percentage = round(proportions(count)*100, 2),\n         order_status = str_to_title(order_status)) |&gt;\n  \n  gt() |&gt;\n  cols_label(order_status = \"Status\",\n             count = md(\"*No.* Orders\"),\n             percentage = \"Percentage\") |&gt; \n  tab_header(\"Order Volume by Order Status\") |&gt;\n  fmt_integer(columns = count) |&gt;\n  tab_style(style = cell_text(\"#52B788\", weight = \"bold\"), \n            locations = cells_body(order_status, 1)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(style = cell_text(\"#FFC300\", weight = \"bold\"), \n            locations = cells_body(order_status, 2)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(style = cell_text(\"#D90429\", weight = \"bold\"), \n            locations = cells_body(order_status, c(3, 4)))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Order Volume by Order Status\n    \n    \n    \n      Status\n      No. Orders\n      Percentage\n    \n  \n  \n    Delivered\n52,724\n97.76\n    Shipped\n567\n1.05\n    Canceled\n315\n0.58\n    Unavailable\n145\n0.27\n    Invoiced\n121\n0.22\n    Processing\n59\n0.11\n    Created\n1\n0.00\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nThe analysis indicates that a significant majority, specifically 97.8%, of the orders where delivered successfully. Successful delivery implies that the orders were processed, shipped, and received by the customers. This high percentage reflects the effectiveness and efficiency of the delivery process.\nA small percentage, approximately 1.05%, of the orders (567 orders) were still in transit at the time of the analysis. These orders indicate that they have been shipped or dispatched but have not yet reached the final customers.\nThe analysis also reveals that a portion of the orders experienced cancellation or unavailability. Approximately 0.58% of all orders (315 orders) were canceled, indicating that these orders were requested to be canceled by either the customers or the seller. The reasons for cancellation can vary, including customer changes of mind, product unavailability, or other logistical or operational factors.\n\n\nOrder status and order month\n\n\nShow the Code\nOSL &lt;- c(\"delivered\", \"shipped\", \"invoiced\", \"processing\", \"canceled\", \"unavailable\")\n\norders |&gt;\n  mutate(order_month = month(order_purchase_timestamp, label = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  group_by(order_month, order_status) |&gt;\n  summarise(count = n()) |&gt;\n  mutate(total_order = sum(count),\n         order_status = factor(order_status, levels = OSL),\n         order_status = str_to_title(order_status)) |&gt;\n  filter(order_status != \"created\") |&gt;\n  \n  \n  ggplot(aes(x = order_month, y = count)) +\n  geom_line(aes(group = 1), color = colr$line, linewidth = 0.7) +\n  facet_wrap(vars(order_status), ncol = 2, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma_format()) +\n  labs(x = NULL, y = \"Count\", title = \"Order Status and Purchase Month\") +\n  custom_theme()\n\n\n\n\n\nThe analysis of the order status across all available months indicates that there was a steady decline in the number of orders shipped after March, with a few exceptions. Specifically, the number of orders shipped decreased steadily from April to June. However, in July, there was an increase of 3% in the total number of shipped orders. The highest cancellation occurred in August which saw a 51% increase in canceled orders. Both processing and delivered order kept declining after March. **********\n \n\n\n\nDuration between purchase date and order approval\n\n\nShow the Code\nclean_duration &lt;- function(string) {\n  stringr::str_extract(string, \"\\\\((.*?)\\\\)\") |&gt; \n    stringr::str_replace(\"~\", \"\") |&gt; \n    stringr::str_replace(\"\\\\(\", \"\") |&gt;\n    stringr::str_replace(\"\\\\)\", \"\")\n}\n\ntemp &lt;- orders |&gt;\n  select(order_purchase_timestamp, order_approved_at) |&gt;\n  mutate(approval_diff = as.numeric(order_approved_at - order_purchase_timestamp),\n         duration = dminutes(x = approval_diff) |&gt; clean_duration()) |&gt;\n  separate(col = duration, into = c(\"d_value\", \"period\"), sep = \" \", remove = FALSE) |&gt;\n  mutate(d_value = as.numeric(d_value),\n         period = factor(period, levels = period_levels))\n\n\n\nTime summary:\n\n\nShow the Code\ntemp |&gt;\n  count(period, sort = FALSE, name = \"count\") |&gt;\n  mutate(percentage = round(proportions(count)*100, 2),\n         period = str_to_title(period),\n         count_label = count) |&gt;\n  \n  gt() |&gt;\n  cols_label(period = md(\"*Unite* of Time\"),\n             count = md(\"*No.* of Order\"),\n             percentage = \"Percentage\",\n             count_label = \" \") |&gt;\n  fmt_integer(columns = count) |&gt;\n  sub_missing() |&gt;\n  tab_style(style = cell_text(weight = \"bold\", color = \"#6C757D\"),\n            locations = cells_body(columns = period)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(cell_text(size = \"small\", weight = \"lighter\"),\n            cells_body(rows = 5)) |&gt;\n  gt_plt_bar(column = count_label, color = colr$bar)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      Unite of Time\n      No. of Order\n      Percentage\n       \n    \n  \n  \n    Minutes\n34,144\n63.31\n          \n    Hours\n10,628\n19.71\n          \n    Days\n9,068\n16.81\n          \n    Weeks\n29\n0.05\n          \n    —\n63\n0.12\n          \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nA significant majority, approximately 63.31%, of the orders were approved within minutes of order initiation. This high percentage suggests an efficient system in place to review and approve orders swiftly, enhancing customer satisfaction and reducing potential delays. On the other end of the spectrum, a small percentage of orders (0.05%) took up to a week to be approved. This indicates that a very limited number of orders experienced delays in the approval process. The analysis highlights that there are more orders approved within hours (19.7%) compared to those that take days (16.8%).\nThe presence of orders that take days for approval suggests that certain factors, such as order complexity, stock availability, or manual review processes, may contribute to the longer approval time for a subset of orders\n\n\n\nMonth summary:\n\n\nShow the Code\norders |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(order_approved_at)) |&gt;\n  mutate(month = month(order_purchase_timestamp, label = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  summarise(count = n(), .by = month) |&gt;\n  \n  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = count)) +\n  geom_col(fill = colr$bar) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = scales::comma(count), y = 300), \n            hjust = 0.5, \n            color = \"#ADB5BD\",\n            size = 5) +\n  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, title = \"Number of Transactions by Month\") +\n  custom_theme(axis.text.y = element_blank())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the Code\ntemp |&gt;\n  mutate(month = month(order_purchase_timestamp, label = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  group_by(month) |&gt;\n  summarise(n_order = n(),\n            median = median(approval_diff, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  mutate(duration = dminutes(x = median) |&gt; clean_duration()) |&gt;\n  separate(col = duration, into = c(\"d_value\", \"period\"), sep = \" \", remove = FALSE) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(median)) |&gt;\n  \n  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = d_value)) +\n  geom_col(fill = colr$bar) +\n  labs(x = NULL, \n       y = \"Minutes\", \n       title = \"Median Duration to Approved Orders\",\n       fill = \"Period\") +\n  custom_theme()\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly stands out as the month with the highest median approval duration, approximately 32.2 minutes. This indicates that, on average, it took slightly longer for orders to be approved in July compared to other months. Also August emerges as the month with the best order approval duration, with an approximate median of 16.83 minutes which indicates that, on average, orders were approved relatively quickly. Interestingly, despite experiencing higher transaction volumes in January and March, these months had median approval duration of 19.2 and 20.6 minutes, respectively. This indicates that even though more orders were being processed during these months, the median approval duration on average where faster than other months except for August.\nBy identifying the factors contributing to longer approval duration and leveraging best practices from months with shorter duration, approval process can be optimize to ensure timely order processing for improved customer satisfaction.\n \n\n\n\nDuration up to carrier\n\n\nShow the Code\ntemp &lt;- orders |&gt;\n  select(order_purchase_timestamp, order_approved_at, order_delivered_carrier_date) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    pur_carr_diff = as.numeric(order_delivered_carrier_date - order_purchase_timestamp),\n    pc_duration = dseconds(x = pur_carr_diff) |&gt; clean_duration(),\n    appr_carr_diff = as.numeric(order_delivered_carrier_date - order_approved_at),\n    ac_duration = dseconds(x = appr_carr_diff) |&gt; clean_duration(),\n  ) |&gt;\n  separate(col = pc_duration, into = c(\"pc_value\", \"pc_period\"), sep = \" \") |&gt;\n  separate(col = ac_duration, into = c(\"ac_value\", \"ac_period\"), sep = \" \") |&gt;\n  mutate(across(c(pc_value, ac_value), as.numeric),\n         across(c(pc_period, ac_period), \\(col) factor(col, levels = period_levels)))\n\n\n\nOrder to Carrier:\n\n\nShow the Code\ntemp |&gt; \n  count(pc_period, name = \"no_order\") |&gt;\n  mutate(percentage = proportions(no_order)*100, \n         pc_period = str_to_title(pc_period),\n         no_order_bar = no_order) |&gt;\n  \n  gt() |&gt;\n  cols_label(pc_period = md(\"*Unite* of Time\"),\n             no_order = md(\"*No.* of Order\"),\n             percentage = \"Percentage\",\n             no_order_bar = \" \") |&gt;\n  fmt_number(columns = percentage) |&gt;\n  fmt_integer(columns = no_order) |&gt;\n  sub_missing() |&gt;\n  tab_style(style = cell_text(weight = \"bold\", color = \"#6C757D\"),\n            locations = cells_body(columns = pc_period)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(cell_text(size = \"small\", weight = \"lighter\"),\n            cells_body(rows = 5)) |&gt;\n  gt_plt_bar(column = no_order_bar, color = colr$bar)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      Unite of Time\n      No. of Order\n      Percentage\n       \n    \n  \n  \n    Minutes\n290\n0.54\n          \n    Hours\n11,402\n21.14\n          \n    Days\n37,826\n70.14\n          \n    Weeks\n3,834\n7.11\n          \n    —\n580\n1.08\n          \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nThe analysis indicates that majority of orders, approximately 70%, were delivered to the carrier within days which suggests that the majority of orders required more time for approval preparation, packaging, and coordination before they could be handed over to the carrier for transportation. Approximately 21.1% of the orders were delivered to the carrier within hours. This subset of orders represents a relatively faster delivery process, indicating that a portion of the orders was quickly approved, prepared and made ready for shipping. While a small percentage, approximately 0.5%, of the orders were delivered to the carrier within minute\n\n\nDelivery to carrier summary:\n\n\nShow the Code\ntemp |&gt;\n  mutate(month = month(order_purchase_timestamp, label = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  \n  group_by(month) |&gt;\n  summarise(no_order = n(),\n            pc_avg = mean(pur_carr_diff, na.rm = TRUE),\n            pc_median = median(pur_carr_diff, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  mutate(pc_duration = dseconds(x = pc_median) |&gt; clean_duration()) |&gt;\n  separate(col = pc_duration, into = c(\"pc_value\", \"pc_period\"), sep = \" \") |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(pc_value)) |&gt;\n  \n  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = pc_value, group = 1)) +\n  geom_line(color = colr$line, linewidth = 0.7) +\n  labs(x = NULL, y = \"Days\", title = \"Median Duration of Product Delivered to Carrier\") +\n  custom_theme()\n\n\n\n\n\nThe analysis reveals a consistent decline in the median number of days for orders to move from sellers to carriers across all months. The decreasing median duration indicates a positive trend toward faster order handover and readiness for transportation. It also suggests an improvement in the efficiency of this phase of the delivery process over time. February stands out as the month with the highest median duration for orders to reach carriers from sellers, with a value of 2.52 days.

This may be a potential breakdown in the order processing system, where orders may have been dispatched to the carrier prematurely, leading to a mismatch between the approval status and the actual delivery process. Looking at the numbers 1,274 orders, accounting for approximately 2.4% of the total, were approved after they had already been delivered to the carrier. Identifying the reasons behind this delay and implementing measures to streamline the approval process can help avoid such instances in the future.\nLooking at the duration, 59.7% of orders took at least a day from the time of approval to the time they were delivered to the carriers. Additionally, 30.4% of orders had duration in hours from approval to delivery.\n\n\n\nShow the Code\ntemp |&gt;\n  select(order_purchase_timestamp, appr_carr_diff, ac_value, ac_period) |&gt;\n  mutate(month = month(order_purchase_timestamp, label = TRUE),\n         approval = if_else(ac_value &lt;= 0, \"After Approval\", \"Before Approval\")) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(approval)) |&gt;\n\n  summarise(avg = mean(appr_carr_diff, na.rm = TRUE),\n            median = median(appr_carr_diff, na.rm = TRUE),\n            .by = c(month, approval)) |&gt;\n  mutate(duration = dseconds(x = median) |&gt; clean_duration()) |&gt;\n  separate(col = duration, into = c(\"value\", \"period\"), sep = \" \") |&gt;\n  mutate(value = str_replace(value, \"-\", \"\")) |&gt;\n  \n  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = value, fill = period)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  facet_wrap(vars(factor(approval, levels = c(\"Before Approval\", \"After Approval\"))), \n             ncol = 1, \n             scales = \"free_y\") +\n  labs(x = NULL, y = \"Duration\", title = \"Duration of Orders From Approval to Carrier\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#BC4B51\", \"#5B8E7D\", \"#52B788\"), name = \"Period\") +\n  custom_theme() \n\n\n\n\n\nThere was a positive decline in the duration it took for products to be delivered to the carrier after approval.

    "text": "Summary\nThe platform delivery analysis report provides valuable insights into various aspects of the delivery process. The report covers order duration, order status, order approval time, delivery to carriers, and delivery to customers. Here are the key highlights:\nOrder Duration:\nThe analysis reveals that the duration of order delivery to customers varied across different months. There was a positive decline in delivery duration over time, with the lowest median duration observed in August. However, a significant proportion of customers received their orders after a week, indicating room for improvement in reducing delivery times.\nOrder Status:\nThe majority of orders were successfully delivered to customers, reflecting a high success rate. However, a small percentage of orders were on transit or canceled, underscoring the importance of effective order tracking and proactive communication with customers regarding order status.\nOrder Approval Time:\nThe report indicates that most orders were approved within minutes of order initiation, while a small fraction took up to a week for approval. This highlights the need for efficient order approval processes to ensure timely order processing and enhance customer satisfaction.\nDelivery to Carriers:\nThe analysis shows that a significant number of orders were delivered to carriers in days, followed by hours and minutes. This suggests the need for streamlined coordination with carriers to ensure smooth and efficient handover of orders for delivery.\n\nBased on the analysis of the platform’s delivery process, here are some recommendations to enhance the overall delivery experience for customers:\nStreamline Order Processing: Efforts should be made to further expedite the order approval process, aiming for faster approval times, particularly for orders that currently experience delays of up to a week. This can help reduce the overall order duration and improve customer satisfaction.\nEnhance Carrier Coordination: Strengthen collaboration with carriers to optimize the delivery process. This includes improving communication channels, ensuring accurate tracking information, and exploring ways to reduce transit times and increase efficiency in order handover."

    "text": "Numerous businesses have experienced the predicament of being unable to fulfill customer demand due to inadequate order quantities and incorrect estimations of the required ordering intervals. As a result, they have experienced a loss in sales. This highlights the critical importance of accurately calculating the reorder point for achieving business success. Hence, it becomes essential to define the reorder point.\nA reorder point is a predetermined inventory level at which a new order is placed to replenish stock before it runs out completely. By accurately determining the reorder point, businesses can ensure uninterrupted product availability, minimize the risk of stockouts, and prevent loss of sales. Using python, we will perform the computation of the reorder point for a retail company."

    "title": "Demystifying Database Normalization: Moving Single CSV Files into a Structured Database",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In today’s data-driven world, businesses often find themselves grappling with large amount of data in order to derive meaningful insights. As this data volume increases, the performance of their existing small-scale data storage solutions, such as storing data in a single CSV file, starts to deteriorate. Consequently, businesses face the risk of not keeping up with the latest market trends and customer purchase patterns. To address this challenge, migrating the data into a database management system, either on-site or in the cloud, provides an excellent solution. In this article, we will explore the process of migrating a single CSV file that contains records tracking customer orders. Additionally, we will delve into the concept of database normalization and outline the steps involved in moving the data.\n\n\n\nERD\n\n\n\nUnderstanding database normalization.\nBefore delving into the details of data migration and normalization of our database, it is crucial to understand the meaning of normalization. So what is database normalization, Database normalization is process of organizing and structuring data to minimize redundancy, improve data integrity, and optimize database performance. Simply put, it involves breaking down a database into multiple related tables, each serving a specific purpose.\nThere are several important reasons for optimizing a database, Such as to:\n\nImproved data integrity by reducing redundancy and inconsistency.\nEfficiently utilize storage by eliminating data duplications.\nEnhance performance and ensure quick response times.\nFacilitate flexibility and scalability for future modifications and expansions.\nAchieve complience and security by implementing a normalized structure that simplifies access control.\n\nWhile i won’t delve too deeply into these concepts to stay focused on the task at hand, it is crucial to have a good understanding of these principles for effective database management.\n\n\nCreating the Database\nBefore migrating your data from a single csv file into a database, it is important to plan the database structure and consider how you will handle data redundancy to ensure data consistency and integrity. Additionaly, there are other important principles to look out for, such as establishing proper relationships between the tables, defining primary and foreign keys, and implementing approprate data validation rules.\nWe will be using the postgreSQL relational database for the migration process and data storage. However, the process will be similar for other relational database. To begin, we will create a database called order_flow where we will be working on as we progress through this article.\n\nCREATE DATABASE order_flow;\n\nThe above query will create a database and establish a new session after you run it. Now that we have a functional database, the next step is to create an initial table that will serve as the container for the data currently residing in the CSV file.\n\nCREATE TABLE denormalized_table (\n    table_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n    product_name VARCHAR(12),\n    supplier_name VARCHAR(35),\n    customer_id INTEGER,\n    order_date TIMESTAMP,\n    ship_date TIMESTAMP,\n    quantity SMALLINT,\n    price DECIMAL(6, 3),\n    customer_first_name VARCHAR(20),\n    customer_last_name VARCHAR(20)\n);\n\nAfter running the above query, you are likely to see a message that says Query returned successfully This message simply indicates that our table has been created successfully. To further confirm the table’s present status, you can run the query below, which will return the column names and an empty row. The empty row is expected since we haven’t inserted any records yet.\n\nSELECT * FROM denormalized_table;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntable_id\nproduct_name\nsupplier_name\ncustomer_id\norder_date\nship_date\nquantity\nprice\ncustomer_first_name\ncustomer_last_name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow it’s time to import the data from the CSV file. We will use the COPY command in PostgreSQL, which allows for importing CSV files. Additionally, we will inclued the CSV HEADER option at the end of the query, without the CSV HEADER option, PostgreSQL would treat the first row of the CSV file as data and attempt to insert it into the table, leading to incorrect data placement and potential data integrity issues. Therefore it is good practice to include the option when importing CSV files.\n\nCOPY denormalized_table (\n    table_id,\n    product_name,\n    supplier_name,\n    customer_id,\n    order_date,\n    ship_date,\n    quantity,\n    price,\n    customer_first_name,\n    customer_last_name\n)\nFROM 'data/orders.csv'\nDELIMITER ','\nCSV HEADER;\n\n\nSELECT * FROM denormalized_table LIMIT 5;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntable_id\nproduct_name\nsupplier_name\ncustomer_id\norder_date\nship_date\nquantity\nprice\ncustomer_first_name\ncustomer_last_name\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\nProduct E\nAustin-Phillips\n79294\n2023-04-19 13:25:16.815733\n2023-04-26 13:25:16.815733\n2\n104.212\nChristine\nGregory\n\n\n1\n1\nProduct C\nTucker Ltd\n46269\n2022-12-12 13:25:16.815733\n2022-12-19 13:25:16.815733\n10\n109.078\nArthur\nThompson\n\n\n2\n2\nProduct E\nAustin-Phillips\n6836\n2023-02-20 13:25:16.815733\n2023-02-24 13:25:16.815733\n7\n110.403\nMary\nDiaz\n\n\n3\n3\nProduct C\nAdams Group\n45014\n2023-04-09 13:25:16.815733\n2023-04-16 13:25:16.815733\n5\n119.123\nFrancisco\nMiller\n\n\n4\n4\nProduct E\nTucker Ltd\n74464\n2023-07-06 13:25:16.815733\n2023-07-11 13:25:16.815733\n5\n109.081\nMiguel\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe duration of the data import process may vary depending on the size of your data. Once the data import is complete, you will receive a message similar to the previous one indicating that the query has returned successfully. If you encounter any issues while importing the data, it is advisable to verify whether the column data types in your table match the data type definitions in the CSV file. Addtionally, ensure that the column positions in both instances are aligned correctly.\nWe have completed the first part of the process by successfully migrating our data into PostgreSQL. In the next part we will begin creating the specific entities.\n \n\n\nDatabase Normalization\nWhen separating your data into separate tables, it is crucial to understand the concept of normal forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, etc.), as these guidelines will assist you in creating an optimized database. Here’s a brief summary of the first three normal forms:\n\nFirst Normal Form (1NF): Eliminate data redundancy and ensures atomic values by organizing data into separate columns within a table.\n\n\nSecond Normal Form (2NF): Builds upon the 1NF and addresses partial depencencies by ensuring that non-key attributes are fully dependent on the entire primary key.\n\n\nThird Normal Form (3NF): Further refines the normalization process by eliminating transitive dependencies, ensuring that non-key attributes are not dependent on other non-key attributes.\n\nBy adhering to the principles of normalization and applying the approprate normal forms, you can effectively structure your database.\nNow, we will start by creating a Product Table that will solely contain infomation about the product and specific attributes related to each listed product.\n\nCREATE TABLE product (\n    prod_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n    prod_name VARCHAR(12) NOT NULL\n);\n\nSELECT * FROM product;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprod_id\nprod_name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust like the product table, we will create a Supplier Table that will store information about the suppliers. This table will allow us capture specific attributes related to each supplier.\n\nCREATE TABLE supplier(\n    sup_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n    sup_name VARCHAR(35) NOT NULL\n);\n\nSELECT * FROM product;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsup_id\nsup_name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Customer Table will store important attributes such as unique customer IDs, first names and last names. These attributes will allow us to uniquely identify and manage customer infomation within the database.\n\nCREATE TABLE customer (\n    cus_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\n    cus_first_name VARCHAR(20),\n    cus_last_name VARCHAR(20)\n);\n\nSELECT * FROM customer;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncus_id\ncus_first_name\ncus_last_name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we have the Order Table, which will serve as our fact table. This table will include fields such as order ID, product ID, suppler ID, customer ID, order date, ship date, quantity ordered and unit price.\n\nCREATE TABLE orders(\n    ord_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n    ord_product_id SERIAL,\n    ord_supplier_id SERIAL,\n    ord_customer_id INTEGER,\n    ord_order_date TIMESTAMP,\n    ord_ship_date TIMESTAMP,\n    ord_quantity SMALLINT,\n    ord_price DECIMAL(6, 3),\n    CONSTRAINT fk_ord_product FOREIGN KEY(ord_product_id) REFERENCES product(prod_id),\n    CONSTRAINT fk_ord_supplier FOREIGN KEY(ord_supplier_id) REFERENCES supplier(sup_id),\n    CONSTRAINT fk_ord_customer FOREIGN KEY(ord_customer_id) REFERENCES customer(cus_id)\n);\n\nSELECT * FROM orders;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nord_id\nord_product_id\nord_supplier_id\nord_customer_id\nord_order_date\nord_ship_date\nord_quantity\nord_price\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the order table serves as our fact table, it will establish foreign keys to the tables mentioned earlier. These foreign keys establish the relationship between the order table and the product, supplier, and customer tables. By linking the fact table with the ralated dimension table through foreign keys, we can perform comprehensive analyses and generate meaningful insights by combining data from different tables.\n \n\n\nAdding data to the various database tables\nAfter successfully creating the various tables, the next step is to migrate the centralized data into their respective tables.\nFor the Product Table, the process is straightforward. From the denormalized_table, we only need the unique product name. PostgreSQL will automatically generate and populate the product ID, which serves as the primary key for the product table.\n\nINSERT INTO product(prod_name)\nSELECT DISTINCT product_name\nFROM denormalized_table\nORDER BY 1;\n\nSELECT * FROM product;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprod_id\nprod_name\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\nProduct A\n\n\n1\n2\nProduct B\n\n\n2\n3\nProduct C\n\n\n3\n4\nProduct D\n\n\n4\n5\nProduct E\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will follow a similar process for the Supplier Table. From the denormalized_table, we will transfer the unique supplier name to the supplier table while the supplier ID will be automatically generated and populated.\n\nINSERT INTO supplier(sup_name)\nSELECT DISTINCT supplier_name\nFROM denormalized_table\nORDER BY 1;\n\nSELECT * FROM supplier;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsup_id\nsup_name\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\nAdams Group\n\n\n1\n2\nAustin-Phillips\n\n\n2\n3\nLarsen, Ballard and Hudson\n\n\n3\n4\nPruitt LLC\n\n\n4\n5\nTucker Ltd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the Customer Table, we will transfer both the customer’s first name and last name from the denormalized_table into the respective columns of the customer table. Additionally, the unique customer ID will also be migrated into the customer table preserving the primary key association.\n\nINSERT INTO customer(\n    cus_id,\n    cus_first_name,\n    cus_last_name\n)\nSELECT DISTINCT customer_id, customer_first_name, customer_last_name\nFROM denormalized_table\nORDER BY 1;\n\nSELECT * FROM customer LIMIT 5;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncus_id\ncus_first_name\ncus_last_name\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\nChristine\nFernandez\n\n\n1\n2\nEric\nJensen\n\n\n2\n3\nEric\nStanley\n\n\n3\n4\nRebecca\nGomez\n\n\n4\n5\nSarah\nHenderson\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, when migrating data into the Orders Table, we will take a different approach. All the attributes for each order will be directly transferred into the orders table, except for the foreign keys representing the product and supplier. To assign the appropriate product and supplier IDs to each record, we will use a subquery. This subquery will extract the respective IDs from the product and supplier tables based on their names.

By organizing the data into separate tables and applying the principles of normalization, we have minimized data redundancy, improved data integrity, and optimized database performance. Through this process, we have created a structured database that facilitate efficient data management, analysis, and retrieval.\nHowever, there are areas where further improvement can be made, such as considering ongoing maintenance and scalability. As the database grows and evolves over time, it may be necessary to revist the normalization process and make adjustments to accommodate new requirements."
