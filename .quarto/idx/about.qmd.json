As someone who is still learning about this field, i am excited to share my journey and insight with you.\n\nOne of my main goals for this blog is to provide a platform for knowledge sharing using tools such as R, Python, SQL, etc. I believe that these tools can help us better understand and optimize supply chain processes, ultimately leading to increase efficiency and cost savings.\n\nI will explore various topics related to SCM, such as inventory optimization, logistics management and demand forecasting. I will also share my experiences with using different data analysis techniques, including data visualization and machine learning.\n\nWhile i am still learning, i hope that my blog can serve as a resource for others who are interested in exploring this fascinating field."},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","highlight-style":"github","css":["styles.css"],"output-file":"about.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.149","theme":{"light":"litera","dark":"superhero"},"title":"About","image":"logo.svg","about":{"template":"jolla","links":[{"icon":"twitter","text":"Twitter","href":"https://twitter.com/Akinwande_ay24?s=09"},{"icon":"linkedin","text":"LinkedIn","href":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/akinwande-ayomide-7bb37a199"},{"icon":"github","text":"Github","href":"https://github.com/akins11/"}]}},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
